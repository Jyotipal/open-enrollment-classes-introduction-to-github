**NOTE: This page needs a more inspiring write-up. Any takers?**

This site is a collaboration between the GitHub Training Team and anyone that wants to learn

The site's [main page](../index.html) is a collection of where each person that's taken our training courses lives.

We invite you to add yourself to the map by (following our self-paced lesson){REQUIRES LINK TO LESSON}.
